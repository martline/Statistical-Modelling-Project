# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
To determine if relationships exists between the number of city bikes available at the various locations and any of the points of interests in the city of our choice (Hamilton, ON, Canada in my case).

## Process
- Get familiar with CityBike API and request information about city of my choice
- Connect to Foursquare and Yelp APIs. Send request for points of interest (POI)
- Join the data from 1st and 2nd part to create new dataframe and then use visualisation to explore the data
- Build a regression model using Python's statsmodels module, to find the relationships between number of bikes and chracteristics of POIs in the city of choice.
### (your step 2)

## Results
Yelp API provides more detailed information rather than Foursquare API. Number of free bikes relates to the restaraunt and park locations in the city.

## Challenges 
Biggest challenge was to properly collect, join and clear data. In addition amount of time for this project was not enough for me to perform all analysis that I wanted to do.
## Future Goals
First of all I would research more for details within each bike station, trying to understand the relationships between certain parameters. I would spend more time performing EDA process and analysing visual results of the data, which could lead to more clear picture of the relationships between parameters.
